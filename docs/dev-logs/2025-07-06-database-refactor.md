# Development Log: 2025-07-06 - Database Type Safety & Test Optimization

## Summary

Tonight's session focused on fixing the SurrealDB integration to properly handle type-safe operations and optimizing the test suite performance.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed SurrealDB Value Unwrapping

SurrealDB returns values in a deeply nested format that was causing deserialization failures:

```json
{
  "Object": {
    "created_at": { "Datetime": "2025-07-06T12:00:00Z" },
    "id": { "Thing": { "tb": "users", "id": { "String": "user-123" } } },
    "is_active": { "Bool": true },
    "name": { "Strand": "Test User" }
  }
}
```

**Solution**: Created `unwrap_surreal_value()` helper that recursively unwraps all SurrealDB wrapper types:
- Object → unwraps inner object
- Datetime → extracts string
- Thing → extracts ID string
- Strand → extracts string value
- Bool → extracts boolean
- Number → handles Float/Int variants
- Array → recursively unwraps elements

### 2. Type-Safe Database Operations

Successfully implemented and tested type-safe database operations:
- All IDs use strongly-typed wrappers (UserId, AgentId, etc.)
- Database operations properly handle SurrealDB's record references
- Fixed schema to use appropriate types (`record` for foreign keys, `any` for enums)

### 3. Custom AgentType Serialization

Fixed issue where Custom agent types were serializing as objects instead of strings:
- Implemented custom Serialize/Deserialize for AgentType enum
- Added `custom:` prefix to prevent future collisions
- Maintains backward compatibility while being forward-safe

### 4. Test Suite Optimization

Moved slow Candle embedding tests from unit tests to integration tests:
- **Before**: Unit tests took 2+ minutes
- **After**: Unit tests run in <1 second (0.42s)
- Candle tests still run but don't block rapid development iteration

### 5. Documentation Updates

Created comprehensive documentation for the changes:
- Database Migration Guide
- Database API Reference
- Updated CLAUDE.md files with current state
- Created proper changelog (with dates, not fake version numbers!)

## Key Learnings

1. **SurrealDB's format is consistent but deeply nested** - Having a generic unwrapper is essential
2. **Type safety pays off** - The compiler caught many potential ID mixup bugs
3. **Test speed matters** - Moving slow tests to integration makes development much more pleasant
4. **Custom serde implementations are powerful** - Solved the AgentType issue elegantly

## Code Quality Improvements

- Removed commented-out code and unused deserializers
- Fixed all compiler warnings
- Ensured tests fail properly (no silent skipping)
- Maintained consistent error handling patterns

## Next Steps

High priority items for next session:
1. Implement task CRUD operations (schema is ready)
2. Add contract/client tracking functionality
3. Complete the Ollama embedding provider
4. Continue migrating agent logic from Letta to pattern-core

## Technical Debt

- Some SurrealDB features aren't fully utilized (transactions)
- BERT models still have dtype issues with Candle
- Need to implement batch operations for better performance
