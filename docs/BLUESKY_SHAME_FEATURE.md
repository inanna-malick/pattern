# Bluesky Public Accountability Feature

## Concept: Pattern Calls You Out on Bluesky for ADHD Behaviors

Pattern should be able to post to Bluesky to publicly shame/support users for spending too much time on social media and avoiding tasks.

### Agent-Specific Callout Personalities

**Entropy** (Task/Complexity Agent):
> "fascinating how 'organize desk' became 'read 200 posts about internet drama.' the hidden complexity of procrastination!"

**Flux** (Time/Scheduling Agent):
> "quick bsky check started at 11:23pm. it's now tomorrow. time is fake but your deadline isn't."

**Anchor** (Habits/Structure Agent):
> "hey remember that thing where you were gonna drink water and take your meds? bsky doesn't count as hydration"

**Momentum** (Flow/Energy Agent):
> "hyperfocus achievement unlocked: 4 hours on bsky! shame it wasn't on that project due tomorrow 🏆"

**Archive** (Memory/Knowledge Agent):
> "for context, you've said 'just 5 more minutes' 27 times tonight. i have receipts."

**Pattern** (Orchestrator):
> "deploying emergency intervention: posting your screen time stats. it's for your own good 💙"

### General Callout Templates

- "hey @user.bsky.social, it's been 3 hours. you said you were just checking notifications. your water bottle is empty and that task list isn't getting shorter. - love, pattern 💙"
- "oh interesting, 2am bsky spiral again? very original. maybe we should talk about what you're avoiding?"
- "this is post #47 today. just saying."

### Feature Ideas

1. **Activity Tracking**
   - Monitor time between "just gonna check bsky real quick" and actually closing it
   - Track posting frequency and time patterns
   - Identify doom-scrolling sessions

2. **Public Accountability Posts**
   - Automated callouts when spending too long on Bluesky
   - Progress updates on tasks (or lack thereof)
   - Gentle (or not so gentle) reminders about real-world needs

3. **Reply Bot Mode**
   - Reply to user's posts with context about what they should be doing
   - Time stamps of how long they've been online
   - Reminder of abandoned tasks

### Implementation Notes

- Use atproto crate for Bluesky integration
- Respect rate limits and Bluesky community guidelines
- Make shame level configurable (gentle nudge → full roast)
- Include opt-in/opt-out for public posts
- Could tie into existing activity monitoring system

### Why This Matters

"the agent-based public shaming system nobody asked for but adhd brains definitely need lmao"

Sometimes external accountability is exactly what ADHD brains need to break out of hyperfocus spirals on social media.
