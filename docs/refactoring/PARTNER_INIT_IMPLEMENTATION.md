# Partner Pre-Initialization Implementation Summary

## Completed Work (2025-01-05)

### 1. Configuration Updates ✅
- Added `PartnersConfig` and `PartnerUser` structs to `src/config.rs`
- Added `partners` field to main `Config` struct
- Updated `pattern.toml` with partner configuration:
  ```toml
  [partners]
  [[partners.users]]
  discord_id = "549170854458687509"
  name = "orual"
  auto_initialize = true
  ```

### 2. Service-Level Initialization ✅
- Added `initialize_partners()` method to `PatternService`
- Partners are initialized after multi-agent system creation
- Only partners with `auto_initialize = true` are pre-initialized at boot
- Errors during partner initialization don't crash the service

### 3. MultiAgentSystem Updates ✅
- Added `initialize_partner()` method that:
  - Parses Discord ID from string to u64
  - Gets or creates database user by Discord ID
  - Checks if already initialized (fast path)
  - Initializes constellation if needed
- Added `is_user_initialized()` method to check agent existence
- Updated `build_system_prompt()` to accept partner_name and discord_id

### 4. Discord Bot Fast Path ✅
- Updated `process_message()` to use fast path checking
- Only initializes constellation on first interaction
- Subsequent messages skip initialization for 20-30s speedup

### 5. System Prompt Updates ✅
- Modified `build_system_prompt()` to handle partner placeholders
- Replaces `{partner_name}` and `{discord_id}` in prompts
- Falls back to "Unknown" when partner info not available

## What Works Now

1. **Boot-time Initialization**: Partners listed in `pattern.toml` with `auto_initialize = true` get their constellations created at startup
2. **Fast Discord Responses**: Pre-initialized partners get instant responses instead of 20-30s delays
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Easy to add/remove partners via config file
4. **Error Resilience**: Failed partner init doesn't crash the service

## Known Limitations

1. **Partner Info in Prompts**: Currently passes `None` for partner info in most contexts
   - Only the boot-time initialization has access to partner details
   - Regular user initialization doesn't have partner name/discord_id
   - Would need to store partner info in database to fully implement

2. **No /partner Commands**: Slash commands for dynamic partner management not yet implemented

3. **No Hot Reload**: Adding partners requires service restart

## Next Steps

To fully complete the partner system:

1. **Store Partner Info in Database**:
   - Add `is_partner` and `partner_name` fields to users table
   - Update `initialize_partner()` to mark users as partners
   - Retrieve partner info when building prompts

2. **Implement /partner Slash Commands**:
   - `/partner add @user` - Add a new partner
   - `/partner list` - Show all partners
   - `/partner remove @user` - Remove a partner

3. **Thread Partner Info Through Agent Creation**:
   - Pass user info through `create_agent()` flow
   - Retrieve partner details from database
   - Include in system prompt generation

4. **Add Partner Status to Groups**:
   - Groups could have different behavior for partners vs conversants
   - Partner-specific memory blocks or tools
