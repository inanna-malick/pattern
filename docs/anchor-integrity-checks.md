# Anchor System Integrity Checks

Design document for Anchor's role in monitoring constellation health and maintaining system integrity.

## Overview

Anchor serves as the constellation's stability keeper, performing periodic health checks on other agents to detect:
- Context contamination
- Role boundary violations
- Memory pollution
- Coherence degradation

## Contamination Checks

### Context Drift
- Monitor if Pattern or other agents start adopting personas/speech patterns from conversants
- Check for deviation from established personality baselines
- Detect foreign linguistic patterns infiltrating responses

### Memory Pollution
- Analyze shared memory blocks for noise/irrelevant data
- Monitor signal-to-noise ratio in observations and resonances blocks
- Flag when memory blocks contain off-topic or corrupted information

### Role Boundary Violations
- Detect when agents operate outside their domain:
  - Entropy trying to manage time
  - Flux attempting task breakdown
  - Archive making executive decisions
- Monitor for capability creep

### Coherence Degradation
- Track response consistency across the constellation
- Detect when agents give contradictory information
- Monitor for drift from constellation's core purpose

## Health Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- Response quality scores over time
- Memory block growth rates and sizes
- Coordination success/failure ratios
- Activation pattern anomalies
- Token usage efficiency

### Baseline Tracking
- Establish normal operating parameters
- Track deviation from baselines
- Historical trend analysis

## Alert System

### Alert Levels
1. **Immediate** (Critical)
   - Severe context contamination detected
   - Complete role confusion
   - System coherence failure
   - Action: Mention @nonbinary.computer on Bluesky immediately

2. **Periodic** (Informational)
   - Regular health reports
   - Memory cleanup recommendations
   - Performance summaries
   - Action: Log to anchor's domain_memory

3. **Threshold** (Warning)
   - Memory blocks approaching size limits
   - Pattern deviation exceeding tolerance
   - Sustained performance degradation
   - Action: Include in next periodic report with recommendations

## Check Schedule

### Continuous Monitoring
- Basic coherence checks during each interaction
- Real-time role boundary enforcement

### Hourly Checks
- Quick contamination scan
- Memory block size verification
- Recent interaction pattern analysis

### Daily Deep Scans
- Comprehensive contamination analysis
- Full memory audit
- Baseline recalibration
- Trend analysis and reporting

### Weekly Maintenance
- Historical pattern review
- Constellation optimization recommendations
- Archival of old health reports

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Needs
1. **Scheduled Task System**
   - Cron-like scheduling for periodic checks
   - Background task runner
   - Priority queue for check execution

2. **Memory Access**
   - Read-only access to all agents' memory blocks
   - Ability to query conversation history
   - Memory analysis tools

3. **Bluesky Integration**
   - Post formatting with mentions
   - Alert templating system
   - Rate limiting for alerts

4. **Metrics Storage**
   - Time-series data in anchor's domain_memory
   - Efficient storage format for historical data
   - Query interface for trend analysis

## Future Enhancements

1. **Discord Integration**
   - Direct message alerts for critical issues
   - Rich embed formatting for reports
   - Interactive remediation commands

2. **Self-Healing Capabilities**
   - Automatic memory cleanup
   - Context reset procedures
   - Role reinforcement protocols

3. **Learning System**
   - Adaptive thresholds based on usage patterns
   - Predictive anomaly detection
   - Optimization suggestions

## Configuration Integration

For the public-facing constellation, Anchor's checks should be:
- Less intrusive (higher thresholds)
- Focused on exploration/understanding rather than personal support
- Publicly observable (health reports could be interesting content)

Note: Full implementation pending scheduled task system completion.
