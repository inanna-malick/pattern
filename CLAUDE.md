# CLAUDE.md - Pattern ADHD Cognitive Support System

Pattern is a multi-agent ADHD support system inspired by MemGPT's architecture to provide external executive function through specialized cognitive agents.

## TODO Management

**IMPORTANT**: Always keep TODOs synchronized between:
1. The TodoWrite/TodoRead tools during development
2. This CLAUDE.md file for persistence across sessions

When starting work, check the TODO list below and load it into TodoWrite.
When finishing work, update this list with any changes.

## Recent Major Updates (2025-07-21)

### Message-Agent Relationships ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Successfully implemented proper graph relationships between agents and messages:

1. **Created AgentMessageRelation edge entity** - Tracks message type, position, and metadata
2. **Integrated ferroid for Snowflake IDs** - Distributed monotonic ordering for message positions
3. **Fixed MessageId handling** - Preserves full string including prefix for API compatibility
4. **Updated all queries** - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
5. **All tests passing** - Including edge cases with rapid message creation

### Entity System Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-01-10)

Successfully integrated the modular entity system throughout the codebase:

1. **Removed old db models** - No more UserDbModel, AgentDbModel, MemoryBlockDbModel
2. **Using macro-generated types** - BaseUser, BaseAgent, BaseTask, BaseMemoryBlock, BaseEvent
3. **Refactored database operations**:
   - Removed redundant `SurrealExt` trait
   - Created focused extension traits:
     - `VectorSearchExt` - for semantic search
     - `LiveQueryExt` - for real-time subscriptions
     - `MemoryOpsExt` - for memory-agent relationships
     - `AgentContextExt` - for complex updates
   - Using generic entity operations for CRUD
4. **Updated all code** - Examples, tests, and implementations now use the new API

### Modular Entity System ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-07-09)

We've successfully implemented a macro-based entity system that:

1. **Separates ADHD concerns from core** - All ADHD-specific types now live in pattern-nd
2. **Uses compile-time macros** - The `define_entity!` macro eliminates boilerplate
3. **Leverages SurrealDB graph relationships** - Proper RELATE queries instead of foreign keys

Key changes:
- Removed `owner_id`, `assigned_agent_id`, etc. from entities
- Created edge tables: `owns`, `created`, `assigned`, `subtask_of`, `remembers`, `scheduled`
- All IDs are now proper `record` types
- Relationships use `record<table>` types
- Helper functions for common RELATE operations

Example:
```rust
// Old way (foreign keys)
let task = Task { owner_id: user.id, assigned_agent_id: Some(agent.id), ... };

// New way (RELATE)
create_task(&db, &task).await?;
relate_user_created_task(&db, &user.id, &task.id).await?;
relate_agent_assigned_task(&db, &agent.id, &task.id, Some("high".to_string())).await?;
```

### What's Removed
- ‚ùå EntityRegistry - not needed with compile-time approach
- ‚ùå ExtensibleEntity trait - macros are simpler
- ‚ùå Direct foreign key fields - use RELATE instead

## Git Workflow - Feature Branches

**IMPORTANT**: Once the project is stable, we use feature branches for all development:

1. **Before starting any work**, create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
   # Examples: feature/add-default-impls, fix/batch-api-errors, docs/improve-examples
   ```

2. **Commit regularly** as you work:
   - After each logical change or set of related edits
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Example: `git commit -m "Add Default impl for UpdateMemoryBlockRequest"`

3. **When feature is complete**, create a pull request to main
   - This keeps main stable and CI runs only on complete changes
   - Allows for code review and discussion

4. **Branch naming conventions**:
   - `feature/` - New features or enhancements
   - `fix/` - Bug fixes
   - `docs/` - Documentation improvements
   - `refactor/` - Code refactoring
   - `test/` - Test additions or improvements

## Development Principles

- **ALWAYS prefer enums to string validation** - Rust enums are very powerful! Use them for type safety. The ability to have unit, tuple, and struct variants means you can have e.g. an `AgentType` enum with all standard agents and then a `Custom(String)` variant as a catch-all.
- **ALWAYS check if files/scripts/functions exist before creating new ones** - Use `ls`, `find`, `grep`, or read existing code first
- Run `cargo check` frequently when producing code. This will help you catch errors early.
- NEVER use `unsafe{}`. If you feel you need to, stop, think about other ways, and ask the user for help if needed.
- NEVER ignore a failing test or change a test to make your code pass
- NEVER ignore a test
- ALWAYS fix compile errors before moving on.
- **ALWAYS ENSURE that tests will fail (via assert or panic with descriptive message) on any error condition**
- Use the web or context7 to help find docs, in addition to any other reference material
- **AVOID C dependencies** - Prefer pure Rust implementations to avoid build complexity
- **Use `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`** on all `Option<T>` fields in serializable types to reduce JSON payload size

## Workspace Structure

The project is now organized as a Rust workspace with the following crates:
- `crates/pattern_core` - Core agent framework and memory system
- `crates/pattern_nd` - Neurodivergent support tools and ADHD agents
- `crates/pattern_mcp` - MCP server implementation
- `crates/pattern_discord` - Discord bot integration
- `crates/pattern_main` - Main orchestrator that ties everything together

**Note**: Crate directories use underscores but package names use hyphens (e.g., directory `pattern_core` contains package `pattern-core`).

### Crate-Specific Documentation

Each crate has its own `CLAUDE.md` file with detailed implementation guidelines:
- [`pattern_core/CLAUDE.md`](./crates/pattern_core/CLAUDE.md) - Agent framework, memory, tools, context building
- [`pattern_nd/CLAUDE.md`](./crates/pattern_nd/CLAUDE.md) - ADHD tools, agent personalities, support patterns
- [`pattern_mcp/CLAUDE.md`](./crates/pattern_mcp/CLAUDE.md) - MCP server, transport layers, tool schemas
- [`pattern_discord/CLAUDE.md`](./crates/pattern_discord/CLAUDE.md) - Discord bot, routing, privacy
- [`pattern_main/CLAUDE.md`](./crates/pattern_main/CLAUDE.md) - Integration, configuration, lifecycle

**When working on a specific crate, always check its CLAUDE.md first for crate-specific patterns and guidelines.**

## MCP Tools & Documentation

See [MCP Integration Guide](./docs/guides/MCP_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed information about available MCP tools and workflows.

## Testing Strategy

All tests should validate actual behavior and be able to fail:
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions with edge cases
- **Integration tests**: Test module interactions
- **Database tests**: Use in-memory SQLite for speed
- **No mock-heavy tests**: Prefer testing real behavior
- **Meaningful assertions**: Tests should catch actual bugs

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo test --lib           # Run all library tests
cargo test --lib -- db::   # Run specific module tests
just pre-commit-all        # Run all checks before committing
```

## Build & Validation Commands

**Required validation before any commit:**

```bash
# 1. Check compilation
cargo check

# 2. Build the project
cargo build

# 3. Run tests
cargo test

# 4. Check formatting
cargo fmt -- --check

# 5. Run clippy lints
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# 6. Run pre-commit hooks (includes formatting)
just pre-commit-all
```

**Quick commands via justfile:**
- `just` - List all available commands
- `just run` - Run the project
- `just watch` - Auto-recompile on changes (using bacon)
- `just pre-commit-all` - Run all pre-commit hooks

**Development workflow:**
1. Make changes
2. Run `cargo check` frequently during development
3. Run `cargo test` to ensure tests pass
4. Run `just pre-commit-all` before committing
5. All checks must pass before creating PR

**Language Server Integration:**
- This project uses the `mcp__language-server` MCP server for enhanced code intelligence
- The language server provides real-time diagnostics, completions, and code navigation
- Errors and warnings from rust-analyzer will be surfaced automatically
- Use language server diagnostics to catch issues before running `cargo check`

cargo run --features binary,mcp     # Just MCP
```

## Partner/Conversant Architecture (2025-07-03)

**Key Distinction**: Pattern uses a partner-centric model to ensure privacy and personalization.

### Terminology
- **Partner**: The person who owns a constellation of agents and gets ADHD support
- **Conversant**: Someone interacting with Pattern through the partner's agents (e.g., in Discord)

### Architecture Overview
```
Single MCP Server (shared infrastructure)
    ‚Üì
Partner 1 Constellation:
- pattern_1 (orchestrator)
- entropy_1, flux_1, archive_1, momentum_1, anchor_1
- Shared memory: partner_1_state, partner_1_context, partner_1_bonds
- Private content: DMs, personal notes, sensitive context

Partner 2 Constellation:
- pattern_2 (orchestrator)
- entropy_2, flux_2, archive_2, momentum_2, anchor_2
- Shared memory: partner_2_state, partner_2_context, partner_2_bonds
- Private content: Isolated from Partner 1

Discord/Platform Context:
- DM from partner ‚Üí exclusive access to their constellation
- Channel message from partner ‚Üí their constellation + channel context
- Channel message from conversant ‚Üí routed through channel owner's constellation
```

### Privacy & Context Isolation
1. **Strict Boundaries**: DM content NEVER bleeds into public channels
2. **Context Loading**: Dynamic memory block swapping based on interaction context
3. **Partner Registry**: Track constellation ownership and access permissions
4. **Channel Context**: Public interactions can see channel history but not private memory

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Agent State Management**: Efficient updates without recreation
   - Update system prompts and configuration on the fly
   - Batch updates for all agents belonging to a user
   - Automatic change detection and updates
2. **Dynamic Memory Loading**:
   - Primary blocks: Partner's personal memory (always loaded)
   - Secondary blocks: Conversant info (loaded for group interactions)
   - Channel blocks: Shared channel context (public interactions only)
3. **Routing Logic**:
   ```rust
   match message_source {
       DM(user_id) => load_partner_constellation(user_id),
       Channel(channel_id, user_id) => {
           let partner = get_channel_owner(channel_id);
           let constellation = load_partner_constellation(partner);
           constellation.add_conversant_context(user_id);
       }
   }
   ```

### Scaling Considerations
- Each partner gets a full constellation (6 agents)
- Agents persist between conversations (no constant recreation)
- Inactive agents can be "hibernated" after timeout
- Multi-partner MCP server handles routing and context switching

### Future Enhancements
- **Agent Pooling**: Share specialist agents across partners for better resource usage
- **Context Inheritance**: Learn from all interactions while maintaining privacy
- **Cross-Partner Insights**: Anonymous pattern detection across all partners
- **Conversant Profiles**: Build understanding of frequent conversants

This architecture ensures:
- Complete privacy for partner's personal context
- Consistent agent personalities within each constellation
- Efficient resource usage through shared infrastructure
- Flexibility for future multi-tenant scenarios

## Future Enhancement Ideas

### Debug Agent Logging Improvements
- **Selective Agent Logging**: Add option to log only specific agents
- **Discord Channel Upload**: Send logs directly to a debug channel
- **Date Range Filtering**: Log only messages from last N hours/days
- **Zip Compression**: Bundle all logs into a downloadable archive
- **Log Formatting Options**: JSON, CSV, or markdown formats
- **Message Filtering**: Filter by message type (user/assistant/tool/etc)
- **Conversation Threading**: Group messages by conversation sessions

### Agent Configuration File
- Move all system prompts to YAML/TOML configuration
- Allow hot-reloading of agent personalities
- Version control for prompt iterations
- Environment-specific configurations (dev/prod)
- Agent capability matrices in config
