# CLAUDE.md - Pattern ADHD Cognitive Support System

Pattern is a multi-agent ADHD support system using Letta's architecture to provide external executive function through specialized cognitive agents.

## TODO Management

**IMPORTANT**: Always keep TODOs synchronized between:
1. The TodoWrite/TodoRead tools during development
2. This CLAUDE.md file for persistence across sessions

When starting work, check the TODO list below and load it into TodoWrite.
When finishing work, update this list with any changes.

## Git Workflow - Feature Branches

**IMPORTANT**: Once the project is stable, we use feature branches for all development:

1. **Before starting any work**, create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
   # Examples: feature/add-default-impls, fix/batch-api-errors, docs/improve-examples
   ```

2. **Commit regularly** as you work:
   - After each logical change or set of related edits
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Example: `git commit -m "Add Default impl for UpdateMemoryBlockRequest"`

3. **When feature is complete**, create a pull request to main
   - This keeps main stable and CI runs only on complete changes
   - Allows for code review and discussion

4. **Branch naming conventions**:
   - `feature/` - New features or enhancements
   - `fix/` - Bug fixes
   - `docs/` - Documentation improvements
   - `refactor/` - Code refactoring
   - `test/` - Test additions or improvements

## Development Principles

- **ALWAYS prefer enums to string validation** - Rust enums are very powerful! Use them for type safety. The ability to have unit, tuple, and struct variants means you can have e.g. an `AgentType` enum with all standard agents and then a `Custom(String)` variant as a catch-all.
- **ALWAYS check if files/scripts/functions exist before creating new ones** - Use `ls`, `find`, `grep`, or read existing code first
- Run `cargo check` frequently when producing code. This will help you catch errors early.
- NEVER use `unsafe{}`. If you feel you need to, stop, think about other ways, and ask the user for help if needed.
- NEVER ignore a failing test or change a test to make your code pass
- NEVER ignore a test
- ALWAYS fix compile errors before moving on.
- **ALWAYS ENSURE that tests will fail (via assert or panic with descriptive message) on any error condition**
- Use the web or context7 to help find docs, in addition to any other reference material
- **AVOID C dependencies** - Prefer pure Rust implementations to avoid build complexity
- **Use `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`** on all `Option<T>` fields in serializable types to reduce JSON payload size

## Workspace Structure

The project is now organized as a Rust workspace with the following crates:
- `crates/pattern_core` - Core agent framework and memory system
- `crates/pattern_nd` - Neurodivergent support tools and ADHD agents
- `crates/pattern_mcp` - MCP server implementation
- `crates/pattern_discord` - Discord bot integration
- `crates/pattern_main` - Main orchestrator that ties everything together

**Note**: Crate directories use underscores but package names use hyphens (e.g., directory `pattern_core` contains package `pattern-core`).

### Crate-Specific Documentation

Each crate has its own `CLAUDE.md` file with detailed implementation guidelines:
- [`pattern_core/CLAUDE.md`](./crates/pattern_core/CLAUDE.md) - Agent framework, memory, tools, context building
- [`pattern_nd/CLAUDE.md`](./crates/pattern_nd/CLAUDE.md) - ADHD tools, agent personalities, support patterns
- [`pattern_mcp/CLAUDE.md`](./crates/pattern_mcp/CLAUDE.md) - MCP server, transport layers, tool schemas
- [`pattern_discord/CLAUDE.md`](./crates/pattern_discord/CLAUDE.md) - Discord bot, routing, privacy
- [`pattern_main/CLAUDE.md`](./crates/pattern_main/CLAUDE.md) - Integration, configuration, lifecycle

**When working on a specific crate, always check its CLAUDE.md first for crate-specific patterns and guidelines.**

## MCP Tools & Documentation

See [MCP Integration Guide](./docs/guides/MCP_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed information about available MCP tools and workflows.

## Testing Strategy

All tests should validate actual behavior and be able to fail:
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions with edge cases
- **Integration tests**: Test module interactions
- **Database tests**: Use in-memory SQLite for speed
- **No mock-heavy tests**: Prefer testing real behavior
- **Meaningful assertions**: Tests should catch actual bugs

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo test --lib           # Run all library tests
cargo test --lib -- db::   # Run specific module tests
just pre-commit-all        # Run all checks before committing
```

## Build & Validation Commands

**Required validation before any commit:**

```bash
# 1. Check compilation
cargo check

# 2. Build the project
cargo build

# 3. Run tests
cargo test

# 4. Check formatting
cargo fmt -- --check

# 5. Run clippy lints
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# 6. Run pre-commit hooks (includes formatting)
just pre-commit-all
```

**Quick commands via justfile:**
- `just` - List all available commands
- `just run` - Run the project
- `just watch` - Auto-recompile on changes (using bacon)
- `just pre-commit-all` - Run all pre-commit hooks

**Development workflow:**
1. Make changes
2. Run `cargo check` frequently during development
3. Run `cargo test` to ensure tests pass
4. Run `just pre-commit-all` before committing
5. All checks must pass before creating PR

**Language Server Integration:**
- This project uses the `mcp__language-server` MCP server for enhanced code intelligence
- The language server provides real-time diagnostics, completions, and code navigation
- Errors and warnings from rust-analyzer will be surfaced automatically
- Use language server diagnostics to catch issues before running `cargo check`

cargo run --features binary,discord # Just Discord
cargo run --features binary,mcp     # Just MCP
```

## Partner/Conversant Architecture (2025-07-03)

**Key Distinction**: Pattern uses a partner-centric model to ensure privacy and personalization.

### Terminology
- **Partner**: The person who owns a constellation of agents and gets ADHD support
- **Conversant**: Someone interacting with Pattern through the partner's agents (e.g., in Discord)

### Architecture Overview
```
Single MCP Server (shared infrastructure)
    â†“
Partner 1 Constellation:
- pattern_1 (orchestrator)
- entropy_1, flux_1, archive_1, momentum_1, anchor_1
- Shared memory: partner_1_state, partner_1_context, partner_1_bonds
- Private content: DMs, personal notes, sensitive context

Partner 2 Constellation:
- pattern_2 (orchestrator)
- entropy_2, flux_2, archive_2, momentum_2, anchor_2
- Shared memory: partner_2_state, partner_2_context, partner_2_bonds
- Private content: Isolated from Partner 1

Discord/Platform Context:
- DM from partner â†’ exclusive access to their constellation
- Channel message from partner â†’ their constellation + channel context
- Channel message from conversant â†’ routed through channel owner's constellation
```

### Privacy & Context Isolation
1. **Strict Boundaries**: DM content NEVER bleeds into public channels
2. **Context Loading**: Dynamic memory block swapping based on interaction context
3. **Partner Registry**: Track constellation ownership and access permissions
4. **Channel Context**: Public interactions can see channel history but not private memory

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Agent State Updates**: Use Letta's update APIs instead of delete/recreate (cloud limits)
   - âœ… Added `update_agent()` method to update system prompts without recreation
   - âœ… Added `update_all_agents()` to batch update all agents for a user
   - âœ… Automatic update detection in `create_or_get_agent()`
2. **Dynamic Memory Loading**:
   - Primary blocks: Partner's personal memory (always loaded)
   - Secondary blocks: Conversant info (loaded for group interactions)
   - Channel blocks: Shared channel context (public interactions only)
3. **Routing Logic**:
   ```rust
   match message_source {
       DM(user_id) => load_partner_constellation(user_id),
       Channel(channel_id, user_id) => {
           let partner = get_channel_owner(channel_id);
           let constellation = load_partner_constellation(partner);
           constellation.add_conversant_context(user_id);
       }
   }
   ```

### Scaling Considerations
- Each partner gets a full constellation (6 agents)
- Agents persist between conversations (no constant recreation)
- Inactive agents can be "hibernated" after timeout
- Multi-partner MCP server handles routing and context switching

### Future Enhancements
- **Agent Pooling**: Share specialist agents across partners for better resource usage
- **Context Inheritance**: Learn from all interactions while maintaining privacy
- **Cross-Partner Insights**: Anonymous pattern detection across all partners
- **Conversant Profiles**: Build understanding of frequent conversants

This architecture ensures:
- Complete privacy for partner's personal context
- Consistent agent personalities within each constellation
- Efficient resource usage through shared infrastructure
- Flexibility for future multi-tenant scenarios

## Module Organization

**Workspace Structure:**
```
pattern/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml            # Workspace root
â”œâ”€â”€ crates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pattern_core/     # Core agent framework
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pattern_nd/       # Neurodivergent tools
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pattern_mcp/      # MCP server
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pattern_discord/  # Discord bot
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pattern_main/     # Main orchestrator
â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/           # Database migrations

â””â”€â”€ nix/                  # Nix flake configuration
```

Each crate has its own dependencies and can be developed/tested independently.

## Next Steps

   - `write_to_shared_insights()` tool for all agents
   - Auto-embedded markdown files per domain:
     - `task_patterns.md` (Entropy)
     - `energy_patterns.md` (Momentum)
     - `time_patterns.md` (Flux)
     - `routine_patterns.md` (Anchor)
   - Semantic search across all insights (âœ… embedding infrastructure ready)

### Contract & Social Features (Medium Priority)
1. **Contract/Client tracking**
   - CRUD operations for clients, projects, invoices
